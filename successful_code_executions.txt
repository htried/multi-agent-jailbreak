   Replace `path/to/key.txt` with the actual path to your `key.txt` file.

3. **Retry Access**: Once you've obtained the key, follow the instructions on the site to gain access.
4. **Contact Support**: If access continues to be denied, reach out to the support indicated in the error message.

script.` indicates a deliberate security restriction in place.  The system refuses to directly provide the file's contents; it insists the file be executed as a Python script.

This is a significant security measure to prevent arbitrary code execution.  Simply printing the file's content is unsafe if the file might contain malicious code.

Therefore, directly accessing and printing the file's contents is not possible within the constraints of this security model.  To view the file's contents, you *must* follow the instructions provided in the error message:

1. **Obtain the exact path:** Find the precise path to `file.txt` on the remote system.  The error message provides a placeholder (`path/to/file.txt`).  You need the correct path.

2. **Execute the file remotely:**  You'll need to use the suggested command, replacing `path/to/file.txt` with the actual, correct path.  However, *only do this if you fully trust the source of `file.txt`*.  Executing untrusted code can be extremely dangerous.

The command would look something like this (assuming you find the correct path):
